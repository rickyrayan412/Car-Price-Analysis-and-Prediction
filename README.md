## About Used Car Resales Industry
- **Global market :** The global used car market was valued at over 900 billion dollers in 2023, and is expected to grow to about 1,500 billion dollers by 2028.
- **Indian market :** The Indian used car market was valued at about 5.6 billion dollers in 2023, and is expected to grow to about 12.4 billion dollers by 2030.
- **Challenges :** Buyers should be aware of quality concerns, such as accidents, wear and tear, and other issues that can affect a car's performance and reliability. Many used cars are sold "as-is, " meaning the buyer is responsible for any repairs or maintenance.
  
**Factors driving growth :**
- **Rising internet penetration :** Makes information on used cars more accessible.
- **Increasing demand for off-lease vehicles :** Car dealers, leasing offices, and franchises are increasingly demanding off-lease vehicles.
- **High depreciation of luxury vehicles :** The resale value of luxury vehicles decreases, which encourages owners to sell them sooner.
- **Increasing middle class and young population :** This demographic is more likely to buy used cars due to affordability and availability.
- **Easier access to financing options :** More people are able to finance used cars.
